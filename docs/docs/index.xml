      <description>Prerequisites This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the command line.&#xA;Allocate has been designed using Supabase for its online storage. If you would prefer an alternative, you will need to modify and build the project accordingly. These instructions only apply to using Supabase. For offline-only use, see Building (Offline).&#xA;MacOS and iOS build targets both require you to build using a Mac. If you do not have access to Apple hardware, consider using a cloud service like codemagic.</description>

      <description>Energy Limits Allocate adapts Spoon Theory into an energy system with reserves and costs&#xA;Users can set and modify their own daily energy total, which acts as a currency for routines and tasks Individual tasks allow you to attach an associated cost to represent the overall strain required to complete&#xA;This cost is used in estimating the amount of extra time a task will take, as well as deplete from your total energy Clearly defined visual feedback for changes in energy helps you gauge how much activity you can healthily take on When reaching or exceeding your daily energy limits, Allocate prevents you from adding more work to your day with a gentle reminder to focus on yourself.</description>

      <description>Packaging Due to the required post-build configurations, it is not possible to automate the process of packaging Allocate for installation on your device. This page contains instructions for how to do so for your desired target operating system. Depending on your target the packaging (and installation) process can be a little tedious, but it should be relatively straightforward.&#xA;A few notes for Apple operating systems:&#xA;Packaging for iOS/MacOS will require you to have, at least, a free developer account If you have a paid developer account, consider following this iOS guide / this MacOS guide These MacOS/iOS instructions assume you have a free developer account A few notes for Linux:</description>

      <description>What is Allocate? Allocate is a task-managing application designed for neurodivergent folk with a goal of achieving healthier work habits and alleviating burnout. Instead of focusing on maximizing productivity by managing tasks, Allocate focuses on managing your energy reserves to prevent you from overworking.&#xA;Why? Typical task-managing applications fail to address the fact that individuals have varying levels of ability and energy to accomplish things within a given day. Working beyond your limits for prolonged periods of time to meet unreachable productivity goals is unsustainable.</description>

Tasks which are particularly unpleasant, strenuous, or overstimulating often require more time than anticipated.</description>

      <title>Why Do I Have To Build Allocate?</title>

      <description>To put it simply, financial cost.&#xA;Allocate is a free and open source application maintained by one person, whom at this time cannot afford the costs involved to scale and distribute the application. Building the application from source ensures that those who wish to use Allocate have sufficient database space to meet their needs.&#xA;The project is intended to be accessible and there are currently no plans to monetize Allocate.</description>
