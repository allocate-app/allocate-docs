## What is Allocate?

Allocate is a task-managing application designed for neurodivergent folk with a goal of achieving healthier work habits and alleviating burnout. Instead of focusing on maximizing productivity by managing tasks, Allocate focuses on managing your [energy reserves]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#energy-costs-and-larger-tasks) to prevent you from overworking.

## Why?
Typical task-managing applications fail to address the fact that individuals have varying levels of ability and energy to accomplish things within a given day. Working beyond your limits for prolonged periods of time to meet unreachable productivity goals is unsustainable.
