## What is Allocate?

Allocate is a self-managing application designed with the goal of achieving healthier work habits and alleviating burnout. Instead of focusing on maximizing productivity by managing tasks, Allocate focuses on managing your [energy reserves]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#energy-costs-and-larger-tasks) to reduce over-exertion and workaholism.

## Why?

Traditional task-managing applications fail to address the fact that individuals have varying levels of ability and energy to accomplish things within a given day. Allocate was designed to address [the author's](https://jordan-clayton.github.io) chronic difficulties with neurodivergent burnout.
