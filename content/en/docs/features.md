## Energy Limits

- Allocate adapts [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) into an energy system with reserves and costs
  - Users can set and modify their own daily [energy total]({{< ref setting-up.md >}}#setting-your-limits), which acts as a currency for [routines]({{< ref setting-routines.md >}}) and [tasks]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}})

- Individual tasks allow you to attach an associated cost to represent the overall strain required to complete
  - This cost is used in estimating the amount of extra time a task will take, as well as deplete from your total energy
  - Clearly defined visual feedback for changes in energy helps you gauge how much activity you can healthily take on

- When reaching or exceeding your daily energy limits, Allocate prevents you from adding more work to [your day]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#my-day) with a gentle reminder to focus on yourself.


## Task Management Features
- Offline-first database design:
  - Allocate lets you keep track of your day without the need for an internet connection
  - Optional online accounts let you keep data synchronized across devices

- Cross-Platform support:
  - Allocate can be [built for]({{< ref building-allocate.md >}}) iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and Linux

- Support for [recurring tasks,]({{<ref setting-tasks.md >}}#repeating-tasks) reminders, and deadlines
- [Notifications for due dates]({{< ref setting-reminders.md >}})
- [Task groups]({{< ref grouping-tasks.md >}})
