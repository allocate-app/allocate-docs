Once you've built and installed Allocate, the application is ready to use from first launch. When you open the application for the first time, you will be greeted with the main screen and a user profile will be set up with default settings.

To get the most of what Allocate has to offer, you should take a little time to personalize your user account.

## Your Account Name

Click the name tile to change the default name to one of your choosing. If you set up online sync, your email will also be shown.

## Setting Your Limits

Allocate's core features rely on a concept of "bandwidth," inspired by [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). Here, "bandwidth" refers to a discrete, finite reserve that represents your total energy and ability to do things such as accomplish tasks or socialize. Allocate encourages you to add weighted costs to your tasks; when these tasks are added to [your day]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#my-day), your reserve depletes accordingly.

- In the settings screen, use the slider to set your Bandwidth anywhere from 0-200

On first sign in, Allocate will upload all of you local data and periodically sync to ensure your data is consistent across devices.
