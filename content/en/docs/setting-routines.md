## Creating a new Routine
Routines can be created from the main Routines screen, or from the [My Day](#daily-routines) screen.

Routine energy costs are calculated as a total sum of its component subtasks, like [large and massive tasks]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#energy-costs-and-larger-tasks)

You can set a [daily routine](#daily-routines) directly from the routine creation/routine editing screens by hitting the main icon

[My Day tasks.]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#my-day)

## Daily Routines

You can set your primary routines from the My Day screen. Each of these will reset their progress at midnight *(local time)*. Their energy costs are accumulated with your My Day total costs.

For unset routines, you can search for an exisiting routine to set, or create a new one from the dropdown menu.
