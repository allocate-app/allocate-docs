## Creating New Tasks

Create a new task via the action button or the tasks screen:

## Energy Costs and Larger Tasks

For small tasks, use the weight slider to set the energy cost:

Larger task costs are determined by the total sum cost of its subtasks:

The amount of energy required to do a given task also affects how long it will take. Tasks which are particularly unpleasant, strenuous, or overstimulating often require more time than anticipated.
- If you include an expected time estimate for tasks and routines, Allocate will use the energy costs to readjust the time estimate to accommodate for extra difficulty 
- This is not always accurate, but it provides an upper limit to allow you plan your day accordingly

## Repeating tasks

Tasks that have a start and end date can be set up to repeat on a daily, weekly, or custom schedule.
- These will appear in the [calendar](#my-day), alongside [deadlines and reminders]({{< ref setting-reminders.md >}})

## My Day

My day is where you can see focused tasks, your [daily routines]({{< ref setting-routines.md >}}#daily-routines), and a calendar of upcoming events.

Both your daily routines and tasks added to your day will deplete from your total energy reserves. If you try to exceed the limit of what you can do, Allocate will prevent you from adding new tasks to help avoid overloading.
