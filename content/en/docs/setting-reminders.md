## Setting Reminders

Reminders are designed to be short notifications to help you keep track of what you need to remember.
- These require a due-date and time to be able to send you a notification to your devices

## Setting Deadlines

Like reminders, deadlines are designed to help you keep track of important things to remember. Deadlines also allow you to set a specific warning date to schedule a notification in advance of a due date.

Both reminders and deadlines will show up in your [calendar]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#my-day), and can also be set to [repeat on a schedule]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}#repeating-tasks).
