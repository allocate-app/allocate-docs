To put it simply, financial cost.

Allocate is a free and open source application maintained by one person, whom at this time cannot afford the costs involved to scale and distribute the application. Building the application from source ensures that those who wish to use Allocate have sufficient database space to meet their needs.

*The project is intended to be accessible and there are currently no plans to monetize Allocate.*

If you would like to support the project financially, please notify [the author](mailto:jordan.clayton@torontomu.ca) so that they may set up an appropriate donation channel. With sufficient resources, Allocate can be distributed via official software sources.
