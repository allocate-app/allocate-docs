Groups are a way to organize collections of related tasks to make them easier to find and quicker to access.

## Quick View

Use the quick view in the main navigation drawer to access your most recently updated groups, add a new group, or see a list of all created groups.

## Creating a Group

Groups can be created from the groups screen, or from the quickview.  Add and remove tasks accordingly here, create new tasks, and search for existing tasks.


### Important to note
- *Removing a task from a group does not delete the task*

- *Tasks can be reordered relative to one another, but completed tasks are grouped separately*
