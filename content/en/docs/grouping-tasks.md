Groups are a way to organize collections of related tasks to make them easier to find and quicker to access.

## Quick View

Use the quick view in the main navigation drawer to access your most recently updated groups, add a new group, or see a list of all created groups.

## Creating a Group

Groups can be created from the groups screen, or from the quickview.  Add and remove tasks accordingly here, create new tasks, and search for existing tasks.

Tasks can also be linked with an existing group when [created or updated]({{< ref setting-tasks.md >}}).

### Important to note
- *Removing a task from a group does not delete the task*

- *Tasks can be reordered relative to one another, but completed tasks are grouped separately*
